        <p className="text-black-600 -mb-4">
            The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to as the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that forms part of the Indian epic Mahabharata. It consists of a conversation between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna, who serves as his charioteer and spiritual guide. This sacred dialogue explores the moral and philosophical dilemmas faced by Arjuna on the battlefield and offers profound insights into duty, righteousness, and the path to spiritual realization.
